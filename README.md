# CSE150_SimpleRouter
This is the final project for CSE 150: Introduction to Computer Networks. This is a simulation of how a simple router works by configuring the routing and firewalls, which runs on Mininet. I created a python script that will implement the topology of the network and another for the controller that will determine the route of a packet and whether a packet should be forwarded or dropped.
